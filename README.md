👋 Hi, I'm Usama Rahman — a passionate frontend developer with 4+ years of experience building fast, user-friendly web apps.

💻 I love working with React, Next.js, Vue, and Laravel, and I’ve shipped production-ready code for eCommerce platforms, compliance tools, and AI-powered apps.

🛠️ Currently a Senior Frontend Developer @ GetFledge, where I lead feature development, streamline UX, and integrate seamlessly with backend systems.

🎓 Pursuing an MS in Artificial Intelligence at Beykoz University, with a growing interest in combining AI and UI for smart, intuitive web experiences.

📍 I mostly work remotely from Pakistan 🇵🇰. Always up for open-source collabs, side projects, or just geeking out over clean code and good design.

Let’s build something cool — or break it, then fix it better. 😄
